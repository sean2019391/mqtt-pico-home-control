## üì¶ Project Overview

This project implements a Wi-Fi-enabled IoT home controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The system monitors temperature, controls a fan motor and RGB LED, and provides a dashboard interface via Adafruit IO. The Pico W interacts with the cloud using MQTT for remote control and displays live data on an OLED screen.

## üìã Detailed Objectives

* Establish a reliable Wi-Fi connection using SSID and password.
* Implement secure MQTT communication using Adafruit IO credentials.
* Simulate temperature readings using a custom algorithm ranging from 24.5¬∞C to 34.5¬∞C.
* Display real-time system status on a 0.96-inch OLED display using the SSD1306 driver.
* Provide fan control via Adafruit IO dashboard toggle switches.
* Enable RGB LED brightness adjustment via PWM, linked to Adafruit IO slider inputs.
* Implement error handling, data synchronization, and system recovery using `uasyncio`.

## üåê Adafruit IO Setup

### 1. Create an Adafruit IO Account

* Go to [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/) and sign up for a free account.
* Once logged in, navigate to **My Key** in the profile menu to find your **Adafruit IO Key**. Keep this key secure, as it is used to authenticate your device.

### 2. Create Feeds

* Go to **Feeds > New Feed** and create the following feeds:

  * `temperature` ‚Äì For temperature data publishing.
  * `fan` ‚Äì For fan control (ON/OFF commands).
  * `led-red` ‚Äì For controlling the Red LED channel (0-255).
  * `led-green` ‚Äì For controlling the Green LED channel (0-255).
  * `led-blue` ‚Äì For controlling the Blue LED channel (0-255).

### 3. Create a Dashboard

* Navigate to **Dashboards > New Dashboard** and name it `IoT Home Controller`.
* Add the following widgets to the dashboard:

  * **Gauge Widget** for `temperature` feed to display real-time temperature.
  * **Toggle Switch** for `fan` feed to control the fan ON/OFF.
  * **Slider Widgets** for `led-red`, `led-green`, `led-blue` feeds to adjust LED brightness.

### 4. Link Widgets to Feeds

* While setting up each widget, select the corresponding feed from the list.
* Configure the slider widgets to range from `0` to `255` for LED brightness control.
* Ensure that the `temperature` gauge displays values from `24` to `35` to match the simulated temperature range.

### 5. MQTT Integration

* Go to **My Key** and copy the following details:

  * **Adafruit IO Username** 
  * **Adafruit IO Key:** The private key generated during setup.
  * **MQTT Broker URL:** `io.adafruit.com`
  * **Ports**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Embedded Software Implementation

**Language:** MicroPython
**IDE:** Thonny IDE

### Libraries Used:

* `network` ‚Äì Wi-Fi management
* `time` ‚Äì Timing and delays
* `machine` ‚Äì GPIO and PWM control
* `uasyncio` ‚Äì Non-blocking, cooperative multitasking
* `umqtt.simple` ‚Äì MQTT communication
* `ssd1306` ‚Äì OLED display driver

### Key Functions:

1. **Wi-Fi Connection:** Establishes connection using SSID and password.
2. **MQTT Client:** Connects to Adafruit IO, subscribes to `fan`, `led-red`, `led-green`, `led-blue` feeds.
3. **Temperature Simulation:** Generates temperature data between 24.5¬∞C and 34.5¬∞C every 5 seconds.
4. **Fan Control:** Toggles fan ON/OFF based on MQTT messages.
5. **RGB LED Control:** Adjusts PWM duty cycle of RGB LEDs based on MQTT slider values.
6. **OLED Display Update:** Displays temperature, fan state, and RGB values.

## üñ•Ô∏è Code Structure & Implementation Details

* `main.py`: Core logic, Wi-Fi connection, and MQTT subscription.
* `ssd1306.py`: SSD1306 OLED driver implementation for I2C and SPI communication.
* `config.py`: Stores Wi-Fi and Adafruit IO credentials.

### Example: Wi-Fi Configuration in `config.py`

```python
WIFI_SSID = 'WIFI_ID'
WIFI_PASSWORD = 'WIFI_Password'
ADAFRUIT_USERNAME = 'Adafruit_Username'
ADAFRUIT_AIO_KEY = 'Adafruit_key'
```

### Example: Main Control Loop in `main.py`

```python
async def main_loop():
    while True:
        client.check_msg()
        temp = read_temp()
        fan_pwm.duty_u16(65535 if fan_on else 0)
        display([
            f"Temp: {temp:.1f}C",
            f"Fan: {'ON' if fan_on else 'OFF'}",
            f"LED: R{red_val} G{green_val} B{blue_val}"
        ])
        client.publish(TEMP_FEED, str(temp))
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
